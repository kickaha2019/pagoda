This list of games only really covers games of interest to
<a href="https://www.alofmethbin.com/Articles/contact/index.html">me</a> to personally play,
that is games with a good story, puzzles, and no
button mashing or platforming or the like. There are far too many games out there
to list every such game, and the selection is to some extent arbitrary. Sorry.
<p>
The game data will not be complete and accurate so don't use it for mission critical purposes
like nuclear power stations etc.
